# A.I Chatbot study project

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Personal project to learn basics workflows for machine learning and Python. If the chatbot will be making sense at all, would be nice to build a game around it.


## Background

The idea of programming your own A.I that can "speak" has been intriguing me for a while. I think this would be the fastest way personally to get something you programmed yourself that would feel alive.
