# A.I Chatbot study project

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Personal project to learn basics workflows for machine learning and Python. If the chatbot will be making sense at all, would be nice to build a game around it using Unity or another game engine.


## Background

The idea of programming your own A.I that can "speak" has been intriguing me for a while. I think this would be the fastest way personally to get something you programmed yourself that would feel alive. This wouldnt solve any real world problems but would be rather for entertaiment purposes. Maybe would have some gaming challenges, or found out certain information from the A.I to pass the game.

## How is it used?

The final product would be update on webpage and users could interact with the bot throu webpage (ex: itch.io).

## Data sources and AI methods

The data would be get from common online discussion pages (reddit, twitter or such).
